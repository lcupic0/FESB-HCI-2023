## 2. Information Architecture and Card Sorting
**Information architecture (IA)** is a research-driven process that focuses on the structure and organization of content within a web-application. Designers use IA when they want to group and arrange all of the information within a application so that is has sense to the user.
Card sorting is a UX research method user to discover how people and potential users group and categorize the information found on the page. Using card sort users group ideas and informations written on cards into different categories in a way that makes sense to them. So we use card sorting to assess the information architecture (IA) of a website and to understand where users expect certain content to be found.

We made a set of card topics related to web page for this type of business.

> Then we categorized and labeled the proposed topics and combined the resulting categories for all personas.
